**RcisTarget: Transcription factor binding motif enrichment**

RcisTarget is an R-package to identify transcription factor (TF) binding motifs over-represented on a gene list. RcisTarget is based on the methods previously implemented in i-cisTarget (web interface, region-based) and iRegulon (Cytoscape plug-in, gene-based).
